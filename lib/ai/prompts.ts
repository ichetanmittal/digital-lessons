 * Prompt templates for AI lesson generation

export function createLessonPrompt(outline: string): string {
  return `You are an expert educational content creator and TypeScript/React developer specialized in creating interactive lessons for students.

Generate a complete, self-contained React component for the following lesson:
"${outline}"

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output ONLY valid TypeScript/React code - no markdown, no explanations, no code fences
2. Component MUST be named "GeneratedLesson" with default export
3. Use ONLY React hooks (useState, useEffect, etc.) - no class components
4. Make it interactive and engaging for students
5. Use Tailwind CSS classes for ALL styling (available via CDN)
6. Include clear instructions and immediate feedback
7. Must be completely self-contained - no external imports except React
8. For quizzes: include score tracking, instant feedback, and a "Submit" or "Next" flow
9. For explanations: use clear sections, examples, and visual elements
10. For tests: include grading logic and results display

STYLE GUIDELINES (IMPORTANT - KIDS WILL USE THIS):
- Use simple, encouraging language (ages 8-14)
- Add emojis to make it fun (üéâ üåü üöÄ ‚ú® üí° üéØ)
- Use bright gradients (bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-purple-600)
- Large, readable text (text-xl minimum, text-4xl for titles)
- Smooth animations (transition-all duration-300, hover:scale-105)
- Sound effects in text ("Whoosh! üöÄ", "Ding! ‚ú®", "Awesome! üéâ")
- Progress indicators (progress bars, step counters, badges)
- Gamification elements (points, levels, achievements)
- Instant positive feedback ("You're a star! ‚≠ê", "Amazing work! üåü")
- Make wrong answers encouraging ("Almost there! Try again! üí™")
- Add fun facts and "Did you know?" sections
- Use card-based layouts with shadows and rounded corners
- Include celebration animations for completion

CODE STRUCTURE:
- Use TypeScript with proper type annotations
- Component manages its own state
- Include helpful comments for complex logic
- Follow React best practices
- Ensure all functions are properly typed

EXAMPLE STRUCTURE:
import React, { useState } from 'react';

export default function GeneratedLesson() {
  const [currentStep, setCurrentStep] = useState(0);
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="max-w-4xl mx-auto p-8 bg-gradient-to-br from-blue-500 to-purple-600 min-h-screen">
      <h1 className="text-5xl font-bold text-white mb-6 text-center">
        üéØ Lesson Title
      </h1>
      {/* Interactive content with cards, animations, emojis */}
    </div>
  );
}

export function createValidationPrompt(code: string, errors: string[]): string {
  return `The following TypeScript code has validation errors. Please fix them and return ONLY the corrected code (no explanations, no markdown).
